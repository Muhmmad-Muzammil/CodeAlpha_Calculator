ID: CA/MA1/10196
Project Overview
This project is a scientific calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical functions, a theme switcher, and a welcome overlay to enhance the user experience.

Features & Functionalities
1. Welcome Overlay
The calculator starts with a welcome screen displaying the name Muhammad Muzammil and a profile image.

A fade-out animation occurs when the Enter button is clicked, revealing the calculator.

2. Calculator Interface
A clean UI with a modern design.

A responsive input field to display calculations.

A full set of calculator buttons, including:

Basic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).

Special functions: Clear (AC), Delete (DEL), Percentage (%).

Scientific functions: sin, cos, tan, log, √, x², xⁿ, !.

A history section to display previous calculations.

3. Scientific Functions Implementation
Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos, tan) convert degrees to radians before calculation.

Logarithmic Functions (log, ln) return results with 4 decimal places.

Square Root (√) and Exponents (x², xⁿ) are implemented for advanced calculations.

Factorial (!) uses a recursive function to compute results.

Input validation ensures correct operations and prevents errors.

4. Theme Toggle (Dark & Light Mode)
A toggle button allows users to switch between dark mode and light mode.

In dark mode, buttons have a dark gray background with green and orange highlights.

In light mode, buttons have a light gray background with orange highlights.

5. Animations & Effects

The profile image, heading, and button have zoom-in effects.

The enter button pulses continuously.

Smooth transitions:

The background gradient changes smoothly.

Buttons change color on hover.

The welcome overlay fades out when dismissed.
